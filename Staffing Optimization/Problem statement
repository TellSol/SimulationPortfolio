Problem Description:
____________________

A facility has customers arriving at a rate of IAT 5 mins deterministically. Processing time is 12 minutes per customer, and the facility currently has 5 servers.
At the 4th hour, the arrivals increase from 5 mins IAT to 2 mins IAT. This lasts for 2 hours and the IAT goes back to normal. 

The simulation runs for a day (8hrs). We want to run three scenarios and look at operating cost, average queue size, max queue size and total customers processed.

The three Scenarios are:
> 5 servers at the facility
> 3 servers at the facility
> 3 servers at the facility until the 4th hour, then add 3 servers for 2 hours, then switch back to 3 servers
